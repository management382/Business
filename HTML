Intitally, I didin't know what to think of this joke shop. Their comedy flew over my head. I'd seen some pranks for April Fools and wanted to 
try my own hand at it. I will definetly get my prank gear from them in the future. My collegues better beware, everyday is April Fools here.

I've always been interested in the high jinks associated with Halloween. I came across Loni and Lonny when I was looking for a way to participate more.

I come to Loni and Lonny's all the time. The staff is very knowledgable and helpful when picking out items. It's a really enjoyable expeience. 
The staff is always knowledgable about the products and how best to use them. If you're looking for a variety of items to cause casual mayhem, 
you should definetly head to Loni and Lonnys!

Loni and Lonny's is my first choice when looking for new toys to use on unsuspecting victims. It also has reliable props for my improv shows. I've never had
something fail me from Loni and Lonny. The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and always up for a laugh. Loni and Lonny's is a place that celebrates
the best about comedy. This is a great place to go if you're looking to expand your slapstick routine. Just keep an eye out for bananas.
